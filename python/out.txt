Lakelands Trail State Park|

Stretching 26 miles through central Michigan, the Lakelands Trail State Park rail-trail has two personalities: rural and suburban. Twenty miles of soft limestone surface from Stockbridge to Pinckney offer a pastoral backdrop, and 6 miles of smooth asphalt carry you through rapidly growing Hamburg Township. The trail is an easy drive from the major population centers of Detroit, Lansing, Jackson and Ann Arbor, which contributes to its popularity.Heading east from the Stockbridge trailhead amid working farms, wide open fields and woods, you will understand why equestrians feel right at home on this trail. A diverse collection of wildflowers and butterflies flourish here, too. The small town of Gregory, followed by the equally quaint Pinckney, add charm to this quiet agricultural area and are good stopping points to enjoy lunch or ice cream or to stock up on supplies.Mountain bikers and walkers have a seamless transition to the trail's paved 6-mile section, where they join skinny tires and strollers to continue through the swiftly developing suburb of Hamburg Township. The woods grow thicker and frequently arch into a canopy, as the trail meanders to Zukey Lake, a popular destination for swimming, boating and fishing. Trail traffic increases when you head east, but the corridor remains a peaceful getaway.Just before reaching Pettysville Road at mile 15.5, there is a tunnel under State Route 36, transporting you safely under the road. At that point there is a large trailhead. A little farther along, the trail skirts along behind shops, restaurants and snack stops in Hamburg Township. There are plans to expand the Lakelands Trail another 16 miles to Jackson, where it would link into Jackson's urban pathway system and provide a journey from sweeping rural vistas to urban conveniences.|

To access the Stockbridge trailhead, take State Route M-106/M-52 south through Stockbridge, crossing Main Street in downtown Stockbridge. After crossing Main Street, the trail is approximately 0.5 mile ahread on the left.To access the eastern trailhead, take Interstate 23 to Exit 54. Head west on State Route M-36/Nine Mile Road. Turn left to head south on Merrill Road. The trailhead at Manly W Bennett Memorial Park is on the left. |

Paint Creek Trail (MI)|

The Paint Creek Trail, opened in 1983, is Michigan's oldest rail-trail. It has many charms: wildlife, historical sites, picnic tables and a lovely creek filled with jumping trout. To help keep tabs on your trip and connect with other area trails, the six trailheads provide large billboard maps and folding trail guides to take with you. Mile markers, left over from the days when this path was a railway, are additionally helpful.Following Paint Creek from Lake Orion south to the city of Rochester, the trail slopes gently downhill. Its crushed limestone surface is a draw for bicyclists, walkers and joggers. Equestrian riders share the path until just outside the Rochester city limits. Just 2 miles from Lake Orion, a prominent historical marker notes the site of the water-powered Carpenter Rudd Mill that stood here until 1926. This is also where you can connect to the Bald Mountain Recreation Area for fishing, swimming and mountain biking.Take special care when leaving the trail and crossing Adams Road, as there is a high volume of traffic and no crossing signal. Continuing on the trail you find an abundance of wildlife, including deer, turtles, frogs and many species of birds as well as wildflowers. There are lots of opportunities to fish along the trail, since Paint Creek itself meanders alongside and crosses the trail. In Oakland Township, Goodison area, there are two trailheads. At mile 5 there is parking only at the Gallagher Road trailhead, and parking is available at the Silverbell Road trailhead at mile 6. At Tienken there is parking and picnic tables. At mile 8.5 Dinosaur Hill Nature Preserve offers hiking trails through 16 acres of all-season beauty. A short way beyond the nature preserve, Rochester Municipal Park on your right provides parking, restrooms and drinking water.Just past the local police department and outside the park are bicycle shops, restaurants, a bank and shops. The rail-trail ends along Rochester Municipal Park, where the Rochester River Walk begins. Follow the walkway south along Paint Creek, through the city of Rochester and behind the Rochester Hills Public Library. When the walkway forks at a gazebo, bear to your left to reach the 16-mile Clinton River Trail. At this point you can go west on the Clinton River Trail or turn east for 2 miles and connect to the Macomb Orchard Trail.|

To reach the Lake Orion trailhead, follow State Route M-24 (Lapeer Road) to Atwater Road. Parking and two trailheads are behind the strip mall on the southeast corner. To reach the Clarkston Road trailhead, follow M-24/Lapeer Road and turn east onto Clarkson; go 1 mile then turn right on Kern Road. Parking is on the left. |

Clinton River Trail|

The Clinton River Trail is a 16-mile recreational trail on an abandoned rail line through the heart of Oakland County, including the cities of Sylvan Lake, Pontiac, Auburn Hills, Rochester Hills and Rochester. The surrounding landscape includes downtowns, industry, residential areas and parks.
The trail roughly parallels, and frequently crosses, the Clinton River. It continues as the existing West Bloomfield Trail to the west and the Macomb Orchard Trail to the east. In Rochester, hop on the Paint Creek Trail via the Rochester Riverwalk to travel north to Lake Orion.
While primarily located on an abandoned railroad grade, the Clinton River Trail includes an approximately 4-mile on-road segment that circumnavigates a gap in the railroad corridor ownership in Pontiac.|

Flint River Trail (MI)|

The Flint River Trail begins near downtown at the University of Michigan-Flint campus and heads north along both sides of the Flint River to Bluebell Beach on the reservoir. Another segment takes you to Stepping Stones Falls. From there, you can take sidewalks and/or the road to pick up the trail again at E. Coldwater Road and carry on to Genesee.Along the way, you will pass through older neighborhoods, a few city parks and learn about Flint's heritage from wayside historical signs. At E. Boulevard Drive, you can take an out-and-back side trip through Kearsley Park. In 2010, the trail was extended from the University of Michigan west into historic Carriage Town, passing by Atwood Stadium, the former "Chevy in the Hole" site, the Kettering University campus and Mott Park. It ends at Ballenger Highway and McLaren Regional Medical Center on Flint's west side.At the northern end, Stepping Stone Falls is a picturesque, manmade waterfall, and the family-friendly Bluebell Beach has a playground and sprayground.The Friends of the Flint River Trail lead bike rides every Sunday, May-October at 2 p.m. from the Flint Farmer's Market.|

The trail is being constructed in segments, with some on-road bike lanes connecting the disjointed trail in sections. The longest contiguous sections lie south of Port Huron to Marysville and between St. Clair and Marine City.Following closely to shores of Lake Huron and the west bank of the St. Clair River, the trail surface is a mix of boardwalks, asphalt paths, rail-trails and safety paths. Portions parallel state highways and county roads, while others pass among woodlands and wetlands.The trail links neighborhoods, state and local parks, beaches, museums, lighthouses, commercial districts, schools and government centers.|

There are numerous access points and places to park along the 54-mile stretch of planned trail system. For more information contact St. Clair County.|

Kensington Metropark Trail|

The Kensington Metropark Trail forms a paved loop around Kent Lake in western Oakland County. The scenic area, which features 4,481 acres of hilly terrain around the large lake, is one of the most popular parks in Michigan, and the trail accommodates inline skaters, runners, walkers and cyclists.
Kensington Metropark also offers a number of equestrian and hiking trails that branch off from the main paved loop. Due to its scenery and recreational amenities, the area is a destination for many users of the three other paved trails that feed into the park. At the south end, the Huron Valley Trail arrives from South Lyon and Wixom, while the Island Lake Pathway rolls in from the adjacent Island Lake Recreation Area. In the north, the Milford Trail transports recreationists from the village of the same name.|

Parking for the Kensington Metropark Trail is available at several locations within the park. Access the Kensington Metropark via the Kent Lake Road exit on Interstate 96.|

Rouge River Gateway Greenway (Hines Park Trail)|

For most of its 20 miles, the Rouge River Gateway Greenway parallels Edward N. Hines Drive through several western suburbs of Detroit: Northville, Plymouth, Livonia, Westland, Garden City and Dearborn. It begins near the Dearborn campus of the University of Michigan and continues northwest along the Middle Rouge River through several parks. Along the way, it offers a diverse mix of views, including the river, woodlands, prairie, small lakes and urban settings.
In Plymouth, the trail connects with the I-275 Metro Trail, a paved north-south trail stretching more than 30 miles.
Note that there may be some flooding on the trail after a heavy rain.|

Parking can be found in Plymouth Riverside Park (intersection of Hines Drive and Riverside Drive in Plymouth), which is notable for its 1926 picnic shelter that's modeled after a train station. A parking lot is also available in Cass Benton Park (off Northville Road in Northville), a hilly park popular for sledding in the winter.|

I-275 Metro Trail|

The I-275 Metro Trail began back in the 1970s as the Michigan Department of Transportation's response to the then-fuel crisis. The original trail linked Wayne, Oakland and Monroe counties along a 40-mile paved route that ran parallel to Interstate 275.
The trail was ahead of its time, but construction standards were not up to the standards of today's pedestrian and bike trails, and the path fell into disrepair. However, thanks to the efforts of MI DOT, along with volunteers, planners and recreation enthusiasts, the I-275 Metro Trail is now alive and well. The new and improved paved path runs between Novi in the north and New Boston in the south.
Along Hines Drive in Plymouth Township, you can connect to the Rouge River Gateway Greenway, which stretches 20 miles through several western suburbs of Detroit. It is necessary to take that trail a short distance to circumvent a small gap in the I-275 Metro Trail.
Just north of Michigan Avenue in Canton, you can also connect to the 4-mile Lower Rouge River Recreation Trail. Farther south, a link to the Wayne County Metroparks Trail allows trail users to visit the Lower Huron, Willow and Oakwoods Metroparks. Trail planners are also working on a connection to the M-5 Metro Trail to the north.|

You can access the I-275 Metro Trail in numerous places along its route, including 8 Mile Road, Ann Arbor Road, Palmer Road and Michigan Avenue. For more information, view the I-275 Metro Trail map.|

Macomb Orchard Trail|

Named for the rich assortment of fruit trees in southeast Michigan, this trail cuts a 23.5-mile arch across the northern portion of Macomb County. Regardless of where you begin, the entire route is relatively flat.
Beginning on its eastern end, the trail starts out in an urban landscape in the heart of Richmond. At the trailhead park, you'll find a gazebo, restrooms, picnic tables, and benches. Out of the city, the trail enters the countryside, passing through lots of fruit orchards, crop fields, and dairy farms.
The western end feels like Upper Michigan with its dense tree canopies. A few miles from trail's end in Shelby, you will cross the Clinton River over a bridge that has large platforms on each side, where you can stop and view the pastureland and the Clinton River. At this western end, the Macomb Orchard Trail connects to the 16-mile Clinton River Trail, which, in turn connects to the the 9-mile Paint Creek Trail.|

To reach the access point in Richmond: Take I-94 and exit west onto Fred W. Moore Highway/Division Road. Turn right onto State Route M-19/Main Street. Turn left onto Water Street. The trailhead is at the intersection of Water and Parker streets. To reach the access point in Washington: Take State Route M-53 toward Washington. Exit at 26 Mile Road then turn right on Van Dyke Road. Turn left onto West Road; the trailhead is 0.4 miles head on the right.The access point in Shelby Township is from a parking lot on the west side of Dequindre Road, just south of 24 Mile Road/Parkdale Road.|

M-5 Metro Trail|

The M-5 Metro Trail runs for 2 miles between Commerce Township and the city of Novi in southeastern Michigan. The paved trail parallels the west side of its namesake roadway (also known as the Haggerty Connector) from 13 Mile Road to 15 Mile Road. Views along the way include businesses and housing developments, though a pleasant respite can be found as the trail travels through Long Park, a nature preserve that wraps around Berry Lake. Here, you'll find picnic tables, trails to explore and wildlife viewing.
In the future, the trail will stretch for 6 miles, including a connection to the I-275 Metro Trail, a paved north-south pathway of more than 30 miles.|

A parking lot is available in Long Park (40558 14 Mile Road, Commerce Township).|

Lower Rouge River Recreation Trail|

The Lower Rouge River Recreation Trail closely follows the river for 4 miles through the town of Canton on the western outskirts of Detroit. The compacted crushed stone pathway includes eight wooden pedestrian bridges over the river that provide lovely views. Most of the trail is heavily wooded.
On its eastern end, you can connect to the I-275 Metro Trail to continue your journey another 33 miles. On its western end, a sidewalk can take you north about a half-mile to Heritage Park, which offers restrooms, picnic areas, a library, museum, golf club, athletic fields and other recreational facilities.|

Parking lots can be found in Heritage Park (Heritage Park Road west of Canton Center Road) near the western end of the trail, or mid-trail off Morton Taylor Road.|

Clinton River Park Trail|

Clinton River Park Trail winds along the east bank of its namesake river in Sterling Heights, a northern suburb of Detroit. The paved trail runs through a tranquil, wooded area; keep a lookout for deer, turtles, and waterfowl. For the more adventurous, a single-track mountain biking trail also parallels the paved pathway.
The trail passes through Jaycee Park and Heritage Park and, near the southern end of the trail, you can cross Clinton River on a wooden pedestrian bridge to enter Dodge Park.|

Parking is available at several trail access points:

Edison Street off of Clinton River Road, 0.25 mile west of Schoenherr Road
Riverland Park off of Riverland Drive between Utica Road and Clinton River Road
Clinton River Park off Van Dyke Avenue, 0.25 mile south of Hall Road (M-59)
