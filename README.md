# perl-learn
perl lessons, usually same file name, ref git log for script variation and explinations

all of the scripts here can be ran, but you will need to change to the file name to something you have locally.

you will also need to change the text to search and replace, etc. 

i have named the file the same thing in every commit, so reference the git log to see what each version does.
