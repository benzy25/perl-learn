<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
So. The Spear-Danes in days gone by<BR>
and the kings who ruled them had courage and greatness.<BR>
We have heard of those princes' heroic campaigns.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
There was Shield Sheafson, scourge of many tribes,<BR>
a wrecker of mead-benches, rampaging among foes.<BR>
This terror of the hall-troops had come far.<BR>
A foundling to start with, he would flourish later on<BR>
as his powers waxed and his worth was proved.<BR>
In the end each clan on the outlying coasts<BR>
beyond the whale-road had to yield to him<BR>
and begin to pay tribute. That was one good king.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
Afterwards a boy-child was born to Shield,<BR>
a cub in the yard, a comfort sent<BR>
by God to that nation. He knew what they had tholed,<BR>
the long times and troubles they'd come through<BR>
without a leader; so the Lord of Life,<BR>
the glorious Almighty, made this man renowned.<BR>
Shield had fathered a famous son:<BR>
Beow's name was known through the north.<BR>
And a young prince must be prudent like that,<BR>
giving freely while his father lives<BR>
so that afterwards in age when fighting starts<BR>
steadfast companions will stand by him<BR>
and hold the line. Behaviour that's admired<BR>
is the path to power among people everywhere.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
Shield was still thriving when his time came<BR>
and he crossed over into the Lord's keeping.<BR>
His warrior band did what he bade them<BR>
when he laid down the law among the Danes:<BR>
they shouldered him out to the sea's flood,<BR>
the chief they revered who had long ruled them.<BR>
A ring-whorled prow rode in the harbour,<BR>
ice-clad, outbound, a craft for a prince.<BR>
They stretched their beloved lord in his boat,<BR>
laid out by the mast, amidships,<BR>
the great ring-giver. Far-fetched treasures<BR>
were piled upon him, and precious gear<BR>
I never heard before of a ship so well furbished<BR>
with battle tackle, bladed weapons<BR>
and coats of mail. The massed treasure<BR>
was loaded on top of him: it would travel far<BR>
on out into the ocean's sway.<BR>
They decked his body no less bountifully<BR>
with offerings than those first ones did<BR>
who cast him away when he was a child<BR>
and launched him alone out over the waves.<BR>
And they set a gold standard up<BR>
high above his head and let him drift<BR>
to wind and tide, bewailing him<BR>
and mourning their loss. No man can tell,<BR>
no wise man in hall or weathered veteran<BR>
knows for certain who salvaged that load.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
Then it fell to Beow to keep the forts.<BR>
He was well regarded and ruled the Danes<BR>
for a long time after his father took leave<BR>
of his life on earth. And then his heir,<BR>
the great Halfdane, held sway<BR>
for as long as he lived, their elder and warlord.<BR>
He was four times a father, this fighter prince:<BR>
one by one they entered the world,<BR>
Heorogar, Hrothgar, the good Halga<BR>
and a daughter, I have heard, who was Onela's queen,<BR>
a balm in bed to the battle-scarred Swede.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
The fortunes of war favoured Hrothgar.<BR>
Friends and kinsmen flocked to his ranks,<BR>
young followers, a force that grew<BR>
to be a mighty army. So his mind turned<BR>
to hall-building: he handed down orders<BR>
for men to work on a great mead-hall<BR>
meant to be a wonder of the world forever;<BR>
it would be his throne-room and there he would dispense<BR>
his God-given goods to young and old&#151;but<BR>
not the common land or people's lives.<BR>
Far and wide through the world, I have heard,<BR>
orders for work to adorn that wallstead<BR>
were sent to many peoples. And soon it stood there,<BR>
finished and ready, in full view,<BR>
the hall of halls. Heorot was the name<BR>
he had settled on it, whose utterance was law.<BR>
Nor did he renege, but doled out rings<BR>
and torques at the table. The hall towered,<BR>
its gables wide and high and awaiting<BR>
a barbarous burning. That doom abided,<BR>
but in time it would come: the killer instinct<BR>
unleashed among in-laws, the blood-lust rampant.</BLOCKQUOTE>
